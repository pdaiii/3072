# 3052
[Live Site](https://js-3052.herokuapp.com/)

3052 is a web application built with vanilla JS where the user shifts tiles on the board to try and create the 3052 tile.

### Controls: Directional arrows to shift tiles around.
* The game begins with two tiles randomly generated on the board.
* When tiles are shifted they either merge or collide with tiles on the board in the proper position if their values match.
* A score is generated to keep track of the number of merged tiles on the board.


### Future Implementations
* Valid move logic. Tiles should not move if there is no possible merge or available movement in direction of user input.
